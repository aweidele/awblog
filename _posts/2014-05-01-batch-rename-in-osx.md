So I was looking for a way to rename a bunch of files sequentially in OSX, and I came across this:

<a href="http://www.macosxtips.co.uk/index_files/batch-rename-multiple-files.php" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-48" src="http://blog.aaronweidele.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/automator-batch-rename.png" alt="automator-batch-rename" width="488" height="483" /></a>

It's a bit tricky to set up at first, but what's great is that it doesn't require installing any new software, OSX already comes with this! Also, once you set it up, you can keep reusing it over and over again!
