Probably the most useful Wordpress plugin for theme development I have ever used in the <a href="http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/" target="_blank">Advanced Custom Fields plugin.</a> I have used it on a number of projects now, and it has really allowed me to develop very complex, robust CMSes. A CMS should be, above all else, extremely easy for the content editors to use. One of the bigger challenges I have come across is how to have multiple content areas on a page, or very complex content content, and have it in a format that editors can use. I have found that the ACF plugin alleviates most of these issues.

<a href="http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43" alt="home-panel-fields" src="http://blog.aaronweidele.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/home-panel-fields.png" width="460" height="401" /></a>

The plugin comes with a number of free field types. One of the most useful ones in the WYSIWYG Editor, which basically creates a whole new content area with a nice user-friendly editor. Also checkboxes and select fields which I have used to create options for certain pages. I have also put a couple paid addons to good use, such as the Gallery and Repeater fields. You can also assign groups of fields to various post types, pages using specific templates, etc.

In addition to being really user-friendly for content editors, it's extremely easy to add this content to your theme! The content comes in the form of an array, so it's flexible and you can do pretty much anything you want with it. It's really enabled me to up my theme-development game.
